Subject
==================

You'll be working on a project that is somehow related to question
answering.  This is very open-ended.  I have some ideas for possible
projects [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PbaxRJ3PpU37vSOWbvP7y4cIjX1p2m2yIwC_cYIqOg/edit?usp=sharing). 

You do not need to implement a new research idea.  It's also possible
to:
* Replicate existing research
* Conduct a thorough literature review

However, the goal is for this to be a well-written, publishable piece
of scholarship.  The writing expectations will be higher if there's
less original research.

Groups
==================

You must form a group of 2-4 students enrolled in this course.  If you
have a project idea and you're not able to convince other people to
work on it, it's probably not that interesting.  You should instead
join another group.

Proposal
==================

The project proposal is a one page PDF document that should describe:

* What is the goal of the project and how you'll know if it worked

* Who is on your team

* What techniques you will explore 

* Your timeline for completing the project (be realistic; you should
  have your first baseline results in a few weeks and then project
  results in about a month: it's better to underpromise and
  overdeliver than the reverse)

Submit this (and all other deliverables) to Gradescope using the team
functionality.

Intro and Related Work
======================

This first deliverable should be written like the first sections of a
conference paper.  It should:

* Explain why what you're doing is important and relevant
* Talk about the contributions you will make (it's okay to be
optimistic here)
* Sketch out the strategy that you'll take in the rest of the
research.
* Review relevant related work.

This obviously has a lot over overlap with the proposal, but the ideas
should be clearer, this should be more clearly written, it should not
assume too much information that we've covered in the course, and it
should include appropriate citations for related work.

If your ideas have changed considerably since the proposal, obviously
rewrite that information.

Baselines
=========================

Throughout the semester, we'll be adding more sections to the paper.
But this might be more of a subsection.  However, it requires more
work!

You'll need to: 
* You have your data
* You've implemented/run baseline techniques that work

This doesn't mean that you need to have your entire experiment plan worked out, but you can include anything that's relevant.  At the bare minimum, for experimental papers you should have the task that you're doing solidified enough to have a one dataset/setting picked out and a model to compare against that you've run on that data.

For a survey/position paper, this should be a complete outline of all the points you want to make even if all sections aren't completely fleshed out.

Draft / Experiment Plan
========================

This deliverable should be a nearly complete draft of the paper except
for the experimental results section.  However, make sure that you
clearly discuss all of the experiments you will run.

For survey position papers, this should be a complete draft.

Revision + Plots
=========================
For this deliverable, you now need to have results and present them well.

Poster Session
======================

We'll have a poster session for students to see everyone's work and
give feedback.

Project Writeup
======================

Taking into account all of the feedback you've gotten, revise your
paper and submit it for the last time!

Grade
======================

The grade will be out of 25 points, broken into five areas:

* _Presentation_: For your poster presentation, do you highlight what
  you did and make people care?  Did you use time well during the
  presentation?

* _Writeup_: Does the writeup explain what you did in a way that is
  clear and effective?

* _Technical Soundness_: Did you use the right tools for the job, and
  did you use them correctly?  Were they relevant to this class?

* _Effort_: Did you do what you say you would, and was it the right
  ammount of effort?

* _Results_:  How well did your techniques perform, and how thorough and insightful is your analysis?

Computational Resources

=============================

Check Piazza for information on how to access our computational
resources.  To request access, send an e-mail to pulkit@cs.umd.edu
with the subject line "CMSC 848Q Project Computational Resources" with
the contact information for everyone in your group.  Please also
direct any technical issues to the TA, who can loop in UMIACS staff as
needed.
