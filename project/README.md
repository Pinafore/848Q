Subject
==================

You'll be working on a project that is somehow related to question
answering.  This is very open-ended.  I have some ideas for possible
projects [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10PbaxRJ3PpU37vSOWbvP7y4cIjX1p2m2yIwC_cYIqOg/edit?usp=sharing). 

You do not need to implement a new research idea.  It's also possible
to:
* Replicate existing research
* Conduct a thorough literature review

However, the goal is for this to be a well-written, publishable piece
of scholarship.  The writing expectations will be higher if there's
less original research.

Groups
==================

You must form a group of 2-4 students enrolled in this course.  If you have a project idea and you're not able to convince two other people to work on it, it's probably not that interesting.  You should instead join another group.  

Proposal
==================

The project proposal is a one page PDF document that should describe:

* What is the goal of the project and how you'll know if it worked

* Who is on your team

* What techniques you will explore 

* Your timeline for completing the project (be realistic; you should
  have your first results by the first deliverable deadline)

Submit this (and all other deliverables) to Gradescope using the team functionality.

Intro and Related Work
======================

This first deliverable should be written like the first sections of a
conference paper.  It should:

* Explain why what you're doing is important and relevant
* Talk about the contributions you will make (it's okay to be
optimistic here)
* Sketch out the strategy that you'll take in the rest of the
research.

This obviously has a lot over overlap with the proposal, but the ideas
should be clearer, this should be more clearly written, and it should
include appropriate citations for related work.

Baselines
=========================

Throughout the semester, we'll be adding more sections to the paper.
But this might be more of a subsection.  However, it requires more
work!

You'll need to: 
* You have your data
* You've implemented/run baseline techniques that work

Draft / Experiment Plan
========================

This deliverable should be a nearly complete draft of the paper except
for the experimental results section.  However, make sure that you
clearly discuss all of the experiments you will run.

Revision + Plots
=========================
For this deliverable, 

Poster Session
======================

We'll have a poster session for students to see everyone's work and
give feedback.

Project Writeup
======================

Taking into account all of the feedback you've gotten, revise your
paper and submit it for the last time!

Grade
======================

The grade will be out of 25 points, broken into five areas:

* _Presentation_: For your poster presentation, do you highlight what
  you did and make people care?  Did you use time well during the
  presentation?

* _Writeup_: Does the writeup explain what you did in a way that is
  clear and effective?

* _Technical Soundness_: Did you use the right tools for the job, and
  did you use them correctly?  Were they relevant to this class?

* _Effort_: Did you do what you say you would, and was it the right
  ammount of effort?

* _Results_:  How well did your techniques perform, and how thorough and insightful is your analysis?

Computational Resources
=============================
Check Piazza for Google Cloud Credits you can use for your project.  In addition, the University of Maryland Center for Machine Learning (CML) provides
computational resources for project-based machine learning projects in
graduate courses.  To request access, send an e-mail to
 kxnguyen@umd.edu with the subject line "CMSC 723 Project
Computational Resources" with the contact information for everyone in
your group.  Please also direct any technical issues to the TA, who
can loop in CML staff as needed.
